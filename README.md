**The Problem**

There are plenty of apps that tell you how to get somewhere, but how do you choose that somewhere?

- When friends are scattered all over london and want to meet at a convenient location for all, how do you find it quickly, simply and fairly?

1. Problems:
  + We never know where the best place to meet everyone is.
  + 

2. Our Aims:
  + To help people find a location that is equal in travel time for everyone
