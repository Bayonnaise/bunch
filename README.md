###What is Bunch?

A group of friends want to meet up. They have apps to recommend bars and apps for planning journeys - but how do they choose the right meetup location in the first place?

They use **Bunch**.

Bunch finds a location that suits the whole group, and it doesn't stop there. It then suggests the best bars, cafes and restaurants in the area, to make a meetup truly hassle-free.

###Project management
Bunch was built using agile methodologies at all times.
- Before any code was written, we sketched out the full roadmap using a Trello board and Google docs.
- We determined our MVP and prioritised tasks to achieve it within the first three days.
- We held standups at the beginning and end of every day to discuss issues and adjust the roadmap.
- We pair-programmed at all times, with the team's odd number allowing for a trio or a roving member as required. Pairs were changed regularly to maximise code understanding.
- We used Github for version control, using multiple branches and merging regularly to minimise conflicts.
- We ended every day with a short refactoring session to keep the code clean.

###Technologies
With a lot of front-end mapping and back-end algorithm work, Bunch gave us the opportunity to use all the tools we'd learned in the previous 10 weeks at Makers Academy.

All code is fully test-driven.

- Platform: Ruby on Rails with an ActiveRecord database
- Back-end: Ruby, JavaScript
- Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JQuery
- Testing: Rspec, Jasmine, Cucumber, Capybara

###APIs
We used [gmaps.js] to geocode addresses and display maps, and [Foursquare] to find and display points of interest.

During the research phase we also investigated various [Google Maps APIs], [TfL], [TransportAPI], [Mapnificent], [Mapumental].
