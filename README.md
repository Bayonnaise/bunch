###What is Bunch?

You're meeting up with a group of friends. You all have apps to recommend bars and apps for planning journeys - but how do you choose a fair meetup location in the first place?

You use **Bunch**.

Bunch takes the pain out of planning by finding a central location that suits the whole group, and suggesting the best bars, cafes and restaurants in the area.

####APIs
Bunch uses [gmaps.js] to geocode addresses and display maps, and [Foursquare] to find and display points of interest.

During the research phase we also investigated various [Google Maps APIs], [TfL], [TransportAPI], [Mapnificent] and [Mapumental].

####Technologies
Combining front-end mapping and back-end algorithm work, Bunch gave us the opportunity to use all the tools we'd learned in the previous 10 weeks at Makers Academy.

**Platform:** Ruby on Rails with a PostgresQL ActiveRecord database

**Coding tools:** Ruby, JavaScript, JQuery, JBuilder, HTML5, CSS3, Mustache, Twitter Bootstrap

**Testing tools:** Rspec, Jasmine, Cucumber, Capybara

####Agile
Bunch was managed, designed and built using agile methodologies.
- Before any code was written, we sketched out the full roadmap using Trello and Google docs.
- We determined our MVP and prioritised tasks to achieve it within the first three days.
- We held standups at the beginning and end of every day to discuss issues and adjust the roadmap.
- We pair-programmed at all times, with the team's odd number allowing for a trio or a roving member as required. Pairs were changed regularly to maximise code understanding.
- We used Github for version control, using multiple branches and merging regularly to minimise conflicts.
- We ended every day with a short refactoring session to keep the code clean.
